/**
 * Locks the PER-COUNTRY scrape cadence, which lives only in each worker app's
 * `[env]` block. `Freshness.defaultScrapeTtl` reads
 * `KINOWO_SCRAPE_FRESHNESS_MINUTES` (default 60) and `WorkerWiring` captures it
 * once into the shared `DueWindow`, so the sweep rate a country actually runs at
 * is decided by its fly toml and nothing else — no `Country` field, no code path
 * a running-JVM test can reach. That makes an accidental edit here silent: the
 * worker just scrapes at the wrong rate until someone reads a graph.
 *
 * DE is deliberately the slow one. Its roster is ~1,533 cinemas across 158
 * Filmstarts regions, ~5x PL, on the box with the least CPU credit and heap
 * headroom in the fleet (see the JVM sizing note in `fly.worker.de.toml`).
 *
 * The mechanism itself — env var overriding the TTL — is covered by
 * `FreshnessStoreSpec`; this spec covers the deployed VALUES.
