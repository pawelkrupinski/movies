/**
 * Live-tunable vertical gaps in a [pl.kinowo.ui.list.FilmCard], read from
 * [LocalCardSpacingStyle] by the card and its showings block.
 *
 * The defaults are the SHIPPING gaps, dialled in on the tuning screen — so
 * production (which never provides its own value) renders exactly as before.
 * The non-prod `ShowtimeTuningScreen` injects an edited copy via
 * `CompositionLocalProvider` to preview spacing changes against the real card.
 * Each field is a DISTINCT spacing property already present in the card layout.
 * Mirrors the role of [ShowtimeChipStyle] for chip styling.
