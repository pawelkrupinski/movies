/**
 * Per-(rating source, film) state that drives the ADAPTIVE refresh interval.
 *
 * Each rating source is re-fetched on a schedule that stretches the longer a
 * film's DISPLAYED value stays put: a fresh or actively-changing film is checked
 * every [[RatingCadence.BaseInterval]]; one whose shown value hasn't moved across
 * several refreshes backs off, doubling each time, up to [[RatingCadence.MaxInterval]].
 * The signal is "did the value the user sees change since the previous scrape"
 * (display precision, not a sub-decimal vote drift — see `RatingDisplay`).
 *
 *  - `unchangedStreak` — consecutive refreshes with no visible change; the backoff
 *    exponent. Reset to 0 on any change.
 *  - `windowChecks` / `windowChanges` — how many refreshes ran, and how many moved
 *    the value, within the current ~7-day tumbling window ([[RatingCadence.Window]]).
 *    Kept as the "how volatile is this rating lately" history; not used by the
 *    interval directly (the streak is), but surfaced for observability.
 *  - `windowStartedAt` / `lastCheckedAt` — window anchor and last-refresh stamp.
 *  - `lastChange` / `prevChange` — the two most recent times the displayed value
 *    moved, with what it moved TO. Survive the window roll (they're the last two
 *    changes ever, for the cadence debug page), unlike the volatility counters.
