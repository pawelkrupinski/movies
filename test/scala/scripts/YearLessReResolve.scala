/**
 * Year-less re-resolution backfill: walks every Mongo row whose key still
 * carries a year and asks TMDB to resolve `(title, None)` — the same lookup
 * the post-MultikinoClient-fix flow performs (ShowtimeCache now publishes
 * `MovieRecordCreated` with year=None for MK films; `tmdb.search` year-less ranking
 * prefers popular exact-title matches).
 *
 * Why this is needed: an earlier wave of rows was keyed by the cinema's
 * scheduling year (treated as the film year), so year-scoped TMDB search
 * picked a coincidentally-same-year film. Example: "Powrót do przyszłości"
 * (cinema reported 2026, then re-keyed to 2024 by `CacheKeyYearBackfill`)
 * resolves to Alienoid 2 (tt20201212) under year-scoped search but to Back
 * to the Future (tt0088763) under year-less ranking. The user has confirmed
 * the year-less answer is what the cinemas actually screen.
 *
 * Strategy per year-keyed row:
 *   - Call `tmdb.search(title, None)` and look up the IMDb id of the hit.
 *   - If the new `imdbId` equals the row's `imdbId`: leave the row alone
 *     (the year-scoped and year-less paths agree, no orphan).
 *   - If different: write a new row at `(title, None)` carrying only the
 *     new TMDB-side fields (imdbId, tmdbId, originalTitle). All score / URL
 *     fields are cleared — they belonged to a different film and will be
 *     refilled by the dedicated `*Ratings` classes on their next ticks.
 *     Delete the old row.
 *
 * Output follows CLAUDE.md: BEFORE → AFTER per row, sampled summary, throughput.
 *
 * Run: sbt "Test/runMain scripts.YearLessReResolve"
